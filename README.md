Recipe website is a user-friendly platform where users can effortlessly create, manage, and share their favorite recipes. With an account, users can save and organize their recipes, update or delete them as needed, and curate personalized recipe collections, such as “Week 1 Meal Plan” or “Picnic Recipes.” Collections can be planned by day, helping users organize meals for an entire week. Users can mark individual recipes or collections as public to share with others and keep private ones for personal use. Future enhancements will allow users to filter recipes by ingredients and generate a complete shopping list for a selected collection, making meal planning and grocery shopping even more convenient.
